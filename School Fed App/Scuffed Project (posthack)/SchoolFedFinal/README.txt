Schoolfed is an easy-to-use budgeting app designed for students.
Many students, including our team members, struggle with budgetingâ€”
especially in this age, where transactions are made with just the swipe
of a card. It turns out that managing finances is a common struggle,
which is why we created Schoolfed.
Directions: Upload or take an image of your receipt in the tab marked
with the camera icon by pressing Play and Capture. Then navigate to
the graph tab to view your spendings by week, month, and location.
Additionally, the sort tab, labelled with a notepad icon, shows your total
spendings at each location from least to greatest!
